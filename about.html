            "When asked about my art, <br>the most important elements are <br>the colors and the emotions." 
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Born in Boulder, Colorado but profoundly impacted and artistically influenced by living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for 13 years. <br><br>When asked about my art, the most important elements are the colors and the emotions. Therefore, I find that I identify with Expressionism the most. The vivid colors and intense personal content evoke this art movement, but the ideas and images are often surreal or dreamy. <br><br>While my main focuses in the university were Psychology and Spanish, as opposed to art, these areas can be seen in every art piece. <br><br>The influence of Latin American cultures plays a significant role in many of my art pieces because of my admiration for the different cultural traditions and beliefs that I have studied and experienced throughout my travels in the Americas. <br><br>Psychology and psychoanalysis also highly affected me, to such an extent, that art has often been an emotional outlet for me not only in terms of expression, but also in terms of realization. On more than one occasion I have understood my life situations better after having finished a painting. They are always inspired and related to my life or my dreams——several paintings were direct adaptations from vivid dreams. <br><br>I find that all of the content in my art holds meaning and is intentional on some level of consciousness but that the reason behind the art is not always immediately evident. More of my earlier work has influences from Mexico due to living in Oaxaca for a period. More recent paintings have been greatly influenced by Brazil, the music and the culture as it is where my soul blossomed and where my heart continues to beat to the seductive rhythms of Brazilian music.</p>
